        We first began by piecing together our robot using the aluminum extrusion. We greased all motors and organized ourselves to place the motors, chains, and wheels. Once fully 
        prepared we all helped set up the chain and wheel system. We struggled with getting the chains to it's perfect length but after a few hours of dedication and hard work we did 
        it. Our next step was wiring. At first we had Aline who dealt with wiring as we all patiently watched and listened to her techniques. Once she was done we tested it but it 
        wouldn't work along with the kill switch. During our March break we spent a whole day trying to rewire and figure out the issue until we finally realized we had a 1 amp fuse.
        We then switched it to a 20 amp fuse and our robot finally worked alongside the kill switch. The next steps were to build a pickup system and add special features to be able 
        to participate in the competition tasks. We are currently still building our robot and dedicating all of our time and care into building our robot whilst having as much fun 
        as we can.
