I've been participating in robotics competitions since sec 4 with my tiny little highschool team, SLI. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the memories and experiences I had then so I've continued into cegep. This is my last year competing and I'm going to miss this so much. It has been rough the last two years with the pandemic and all. I think I take robotics a little too seriously. I consider it my baby. I'll fight tooth and nail for it's survival to get administrations to recognize the work the club does. Do I procrastinate on my homework too much for this club? Maybe but I still survive and have a pretty good R-score. I still had so much fun these last two years but I wish the new members I've pursuaded to join would've experience what I experienced. That's my biggest motivation to continue robotics and keep it alive, so other people can obtain this love for building things, challenging themselves, meeting new people, everything that comes with robotics and the CRC. 
      Since this is my last year doing this with the CRC, I will share the defining feature all past team mates mock me by. I have a HUGE love for duct tape. Ask anyone, it is my first suggestion to all problems. The most ubsurd use for duct tape that I've done is attaching a banebot motor to the frame using duct tape and attaching aluminum extrusion at a 45 degree angle with duct tape. All of this was done in one comp, our robot looked incredible. My last advice to all. Duct tape is your best friend. It can do anything.";
